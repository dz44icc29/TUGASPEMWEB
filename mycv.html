                <h2>Personal Biography</h2>
                <p>I was born in Bengkulu City on May 19, 2006. I am the second child of two siblings,
                and people usually call me Dzaki. Since childhood, I have had a strong passion for
                technology.</p>
                <p> My curiosity and enthusiasm for problem-solving have driven me to
                continuously improve my technical skills and critical thinking abilities.
                I strongly believe in my life motto: "Keep thinking and learning."</p>
                <p>This principle motivates me to keep exploring new knowledge and pushing my boundaries to achieve
                excellence. As a student at Universitas Brawijaya, I have participated in various
                projects and research activities.</p> 
                <p>One of my notable achievements includes receiving an award for identifying security vulnerabilities 
                in my university main website through penetration testing. I am also involved in multiple student 
                organizations, including the Himpunan Mahasiswa Departemen Sistem Informasi and Basic Computing Community (BCC),
                where I contribute to discussions and projects related to data science and cybersecurity.</p>
